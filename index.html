                        <p>
                            From May to August, I will be open for booking as a tutor for high-school and elementary 
                            school courses. As an engineering student, I’ve developed a deep understanding of topics 
                            in science and mathematics including physics, chemistry, calculus, computer science, and 
                            report writing. I’m excited to share my expertise with students who are in the same position 
                            I was in just a few years ago.

                        <h3>Programming Lessons</h3>
                        <p>
                            I remember taking my first computer science course five years ago, where I learned the 
                            fundamentals of the programming language Python. I gained an understanding of how 
                            programming works, but for years I found it difficult to apply my skills to larger projects 
                            which solve real problems. Eventually, I broke this plateau when I created my project with
                            the Queen’s Engineering Software Team, where I used computer vision to track the user’s
                            form while doing bicep curls. Now, after learning seven programming languages, I’m confident
                            I can help students of all ages develop their programming skills until they can put together an 
                            impressive science fair project and win thousands in scholarships. Check out some of my projects below!

                        <h3>Counselling</h3>
                        <p>
                            After graduating from high school, I was able to secure over <strong>$8,000</strong> in scholarships 
                            and bursaries to fund my university education, and I was accepted into every engineering 
                            program I applied to (McMaster, Queen’s, and Western). However, if I knew everything 
                            about scholarships that I know now, I’m confident I would’ve been able to secure thousands
                            more in funding. I will be available to provide counselling for students, pointing them in the
                            right direction for university applications and financial awards.

                    <p>
                        I’m a third-year computer engineering and mathematics student at Queen’s 
                        University with a keen interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
                        Through my course work, I’ve developed a deep understanding of mathematics through 
                        courses such as Advanced Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Real Analysis. I have also 
                        developed my computer programming skills through computer science classes, as well as online tutorials 
                        and courses in my spare time.

                    <p>
                        Through my involvement with QMIND, the largest undergraduate artificial intelligence 
                        team in Canada, I’ve been able to learn and apply a variety of new technologies, also 
                        reinforcing my programming skills. I’m excited to teach beginners everything I’ve learned 
                        throughout my four years of programming experience; check out my previous projects below!
